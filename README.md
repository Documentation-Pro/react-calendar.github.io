# Overview of React Calendar User Documentation

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This documentation will guide you through setting up a [React Calendar](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/) component inside your [React](https://react.dev/) application.

If you would like to see what your calendar will look like, click [here](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/sample/)

The goal of this documentation is to provide you with enough information to build your first React application and embed a React Calendar component inside of it.

These are the included topics of this document

* Installing React Calendar
* Project Structure
* Styling React Calendar
* Event Listeners

We used [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Discord](https://discord.com/) to collaborate on the documentation.

## How We Created Our Guide

Our guide was created using our pre existing knowledge from setting up and using [React](https://react.dev/) and testing out new packages and libraries, we stumbled upon [React Calendar](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/) which we both really liked and were considering possibly using it in our upcoming IDSP.

## Using MkDocs

We used [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to power the documentation as our Instructor instructed us to.

## Using Markdown

This documentation was the first we've written and we both haven't ever wrote in Markdown before.

## Readability

In general, developers tend to read technical writing in order to get things done. We made sure to write in a clear and concise way to ensure it will be seamless to read and get the Calendar installed.

As for [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), we have made several changes during the making of this documentation in terms of readability. One being high contrast text/background. All of the important sections are made clear to the user by bolding/italicizing etc.

## Conclusion

Our document was built on our understanding of [React](https://react.dev) and the [react-calendar](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/) library. This topic was easy for us to provide documentation on because we both have 3+ years using React from our deployed date.

Thank you for following along and for your interest in reading our user documentation. We hope it will help you both install and use [react-calendar](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/) as it had for us and will in the future to look back on.
