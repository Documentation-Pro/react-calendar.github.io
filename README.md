# Overview of React Calendar User Documentation

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This documentation will guide you through setting up a [React Calendar](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/) component inside your [React](https://react.dev/) application.

If you would like to see what your calendar will look like, click [here](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/sample/)

This documentation provides enough information to build your first React application and embed a React Calendar component.

These are the included topics of this document

* Installing React Calendar
* Project Structure
* Styling React Calendar
* Event Listeners

We used [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Discord](https://discord.com/) to collaborate on the documentation.

## How We Created Our Guide

Our guide was created using our pre-existing knowledge from setting up and using [React](https://react.dev/) and testing out new packages and libraries. We stumbled upon [React Calendar](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/), which we both liked and considered possibly using in our upcoming IDSP.

## Using MkDocs

We used [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to power the documentation as our Instructor instructed us to.

## Using Markdown

This documentation was the first we've written and have yet to ever write in Markdown. Creating this documentation on React calendar was a great learning experience for us!

## Readability

In general, developers read technical writing to get things done. We made sure to write clearly and concisely to ensure it will be seamless to read and install the Calendar.
As for [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), we have made several changes during the making of this documentation in terms of readability. One is high-contrast text/background. All important sections are made clear to the user by bolding/italicizing etc.

## Conclusion

This document is based on our understanding of [React](https://react.dev) and the [react-calendar](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/) library. This topic was easy for us to provide documentation on because we both have 3+ years of using React from our deployed date.

Thank you for following along and for your interest in reading our user documentation. It will help you install and use [react-calendar](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/) as it had for us and will in the future look back on.

*This document was built on the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme*.
