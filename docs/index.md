Our documentation is targeted towards the following users:

Beginner developers who need to set up a React Calendar for a personal project.
  
!!! Info
    Prerequisites:

    - Basic understanding of Command Line Interface.
    - Basic understanding of Visual Studio Code.
    - Basic proficiency of Node package manager.


## Getting Started

To use React Calendar in your project, you'll need to have the following pre-requisites installed:

 > [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en) Node Environment is required to use React and React Calendar

 > [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Working with documentation requires a text editor, please install VS Code or you can work with your favorite text editor

## Basic Usage
Once you have React Calendar installed, you can use it in your [React](https://react.dev/) application by importing the Calendar component and rendering it in your component. If you are not familiar with React, this may be a difficult task at first, that's why we are going to show you. ðŸ˜Ž Here's an example of how to use React Calendar in a basic React component:


``` javaScript linenums="1"
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Calendar from 'react-calendar';

function MyApp() {
    const [value, onChange] = useState(new Date());

    return (
        <div>
            <Calendar onChange={onChange} value={value} />
        </div>
    );
}
export default MyApp;
```

So in this example, we are importing the Calendar component from the react-calendar package and using the useState hook to manage the state of the selected date. State manages the variables binded to a react component.

If you're not familiar with [React](https://react.dev/) hooks, you can find out more about them [here](https://react.dev/learn#using-hooks)

We then render the Calendar component with the onChange and value props to enable date selection and update the selected date state.

This is just a basic example of how to use [React Calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar), and that you can definitely customize it to suit your needs by passing additional props and styles to the Calendar component as needed.

## Advanced Usage

Once you've gotten the hang of things mentioned above in the basic usage section, you might be interested in getting more advanced with [React Calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar).

Thankfully, [React Calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar) provides many props and options for customization. Here are some common props that you can use to customize your calendar:

!!! Info
    Again, please keep in mind that there are many more available props to use.

    You can find a list of all of the available props [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar)

### Props

Props are the arguements passed to a react component. Props determines the behavior of a component.


* `value` : sets the selected date.
* `onChange` : a function that is called when the date selection changes.
* `minDate` and `maxDate` : sets the minimum and maximum selectable dates.
* `calendarType` : sets the calendar type (e.g., US or ISO 8601).
* `showNavigation` : shows or hides the navigation buttons.
* `tileClassName` : a function that is called for each tile to set the class name.
* `tileContent` : a function that is called for each tile to set the content.

### Styling

If you want to use default Calendar styling to build upon its existings syles, you can import React-Calendar's styles by importing Calendar.css

```javascript
import 'react-calendar/dist/Calendar.css';
```
